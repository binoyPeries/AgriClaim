## Introduction

This project focuses on creating a mobile application to assess the crop damage incurred by Sri Lankan farmers due to various reasons and provide a way for them to get compensation from the government. The mobile application (as we have outlined so far) can be used by farmers and government officers who have been assigned for crop damage assessment.

The current system involves a visit by the assigned government officer to the farm, where the damage will be assessed and appropriate paperwork will be submitted to the relevant governing body. The paperwork will have to be approved for the farmer to receive the compensation. However, this existing system is time consuming and will not account for fraudulent claims.

The proposed solution will digitise this process and allow farmers to submit claims electronically via the mobile application, and the government officers can view and assess the claim via the mobile application without having to go to the farm. The compensation will be collected by the farmer via their bank account or in person, based on their preference.
